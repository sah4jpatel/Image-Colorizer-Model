# Image Colorizer Model
This is a project built on PyTorch to explore the use of convolutional nueral networks to synthesize image color data from grayscale data. This required the use od CUDA acceleration and various data augmentation and processing techniques to improve the quality of the model.

#Usage
The single jupyter notebook handles the training and testing of the model. The user can test other images by modifying the file paths used in this code.
